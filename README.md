# Otaku's World Store

Otaku's World Store is an anime accessories store website. It includes pages such as the home page, product list page, item description page, cart page, and checkout page. The project was initially designed two years ago and started by 5 people from the Chingu organization. However, due to a tight deadline of 6 weeks and a lot of work, only two people were left to complete the project.

## **Usage**

To access the website, go to https://otakus-world-store.netlify.app/. You can navigate to the product list page from the homepage, where you can view anime action figures. Additionally, the third card on the homepage leads to the product page (still in progress), and the cart icon in the navigation bar leads to the cart page, where you can click on the "Proceed to Order" button to access the checkout page (also still in progress).

## **Current Status**

The homepage and product list page are done and responsive. The product page is almost complete, and the cart page is completely finished. However, the checkout page is still a work in progress, and there are some issues with the responsiveness of the card and catalog components.

## **Technologies Used**

This project is created using Tailwind and React.js. It is deployed on Netlify.

## **Contributors**
